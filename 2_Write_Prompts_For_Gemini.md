# 🧩 Step 1: Review the Scenario

You are a **new data professional** at a healthcare company that sells sustainable medical devices.
Your team’s goal: **develop a machine learning model to predict future sales.**
You’ll use conversational AI (like Gemini or ChatGPT) to support each step of the project.

# 🧭 Step 2: Apply Best Practices for Writing Prompts

When writing prompts, remember to:

* Be **clear, concise, and precise** about what you need.
* **Provide context** about the project or dataset.
* **Assign a role** to the LLM (e.g., “Act as a data scientist”).
* **Specify inputs and outputs** (e.g., “Write Python code,” “Generate a summary document”).
* **Experiment with multiple prompts** for better insights.

# 🧠 Step 3: Example Prompts (Five Total)

Below are **five high-quality example prompts** you can use with Gemini (or any LLM like ChatGPT).
Each one aligns with a stage in the project described in the activity instructions.

---

## **Prompt 1 — Collaboration / Brainstorming**

> *Act as a data scientist. I am organizing a kickoff meeting for a project to build a machine learning model that predicts future sales of sustainable medical devices for hospitals and clinics. Create a shared document outline for a brainstorming session among data professionals. The document should include discussion topics, goals, project timeline, and key deliverables.*

✅ **Why it works:**

* Defines the role of the LLM
* Provides clear context and goals
* Requests a specific output (a shared document outline)

---

## **Prompt 2 — Data Cleaning**

> *Act as a Python data analyst. Write Python code using pandas to clean a sales dataset by removing missing values, outliers, and duplicate records. Include comments in the code that explain each step clearly so new team members can understand the process.*

✅ **Why it works:**

* Specifies the programming language and library
* Gives detailed but focused instructions
* Requests well-documented code

---

## **Prompt 3 — Data Visualization**

> *Act as a data visualization expert. Suggest useful visualizations for a clean sales dataset from a healthcare company. The dataset includes columns such as `region`, `sales_amount`, `product_type`, `sales_date`, and `customer_type`. Explain what insights each visualization could reveal and which Python libraries are best for creating them.*

✅ **Why it works:**

* Gives context (dataset columns and domain)
* Asks for both visuals and interpretation
* Encourages tool recommendations

---

## **Prompt 4 — Machine Learning Understanding**

> *Act as a machine learning mentor. Explain the main uses and benefits of machine learning in data work, especially in predicting future sales in the healthcare industry. Include examples of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques relevant to sales prediction.*

✅ **Why it works:**

* Focuses on conceptual understanding
* Tailors the explanation to the healthcare context
* Requests specific examples

---

## **Prompt 5 — Executive Summary**

> *Act as a communications expert. Provide best practices for writing an executive summary of a data science project for company leaders who do not have a technical background. Include tips on clarity, tone, key metrics to highlight, and how to present machine learning results effectively.*

✅ **Why it works:**

* Assigns a clear role
* Focuses on communication skills
* Connects the guidance to a business audience

---

# ✅ Step 4: Reflection / Optional Discussion Points

After trying your prompts in Gemini, reflect briefly (this may be required in your submission):

* **What did you learn?**
  You might note that conversational AI can quickly generate structured outlines, example code, and clear explanations that support various stages of data work.

* **What are its limitations?**
  You might mention that Gemini sometimes generates generic or inaccurate code and that human verification is always needed.
