# **Predictive Maintenance Project Proposal**

## **Project Title**

**Machine Learning Model for Predictive Maintenance of Delivery Vehicles**

---

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to **develop a machine learning model capable of predicting vehicle component failures before they occur**.
By analyzing both historical maintenance data and real-time sensor data from delivery vehicles, the model will help the company reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, enhance safety, and improve overall operational efficiency.
The target performance metric is **at least 90% accuracy** in predicting potential failures.

## **Project Scope**

This project will focus on:

* Collecting and preparing relevant vehicle and maintenance data.
* Building and testing predictive machine learning models.
* Sharing progress and insights with stakeholders at key stages.
* Delivering a validated, production-ready predictive maintenance model.

The proposed project duration is **12 weeks**.
