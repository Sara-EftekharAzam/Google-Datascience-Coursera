**Email #1: Email to a new data professional on the NPS data team**

Dear Akbar,

My name is [Your Name], one of the data professionals with the National Park Service and a member of the data team responsible for the visitation prediction project.

Welcome to the team! I’m excited to have you join us as we begin work on our new machine learning model to predict future visitation rates at the most visited national parks. The main goal of this project is to achieve at least 90% prediction accuracy using historical recreation data, along with variables like weather, temperature, park fees, and traffic conditions. 

Our workflow follows a structured 12-week timeline, starting with data collection and cleaning, followed by exploratory analysis, model selection and training, validation, and reporting. We’ll collaborate closely using shared tools like Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub for version control. The insights from this model will help park managers make data-driven decisions about staffing, infrastructure upgrades, and visitor management strategies.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the project, datasets, or tools we use. I’m happy to help you get started.

Best regards,

**Email #2: Email to a new writer for NPS public relations**

Dear Victoria,

My name is [Your Name], one of the data professionals with the National Park Service and a member of the data team responsible for the visitation prediction project.

Welcome aboard! I wanted to provide an overview of the project so you can better understand our goals and communicate our efforts to the public. Our team is developing a machine learning model that will predict future visitation trends at the most visited national parks. This model will use factors like weather, park fees, and traffic to anticipate changes in visitor numbers with about 90% accuracy.

The purpose of this project is to help park managers plan ahead—by protecting natural resources, improving visitor experiences, and reducing overcrowding. For example, the predictions could inform when to increase staffing, renovate facilities, or enhance the park reservation system. Communicating these initiatives to the public helps highlight how the NPS uses technology and data to ensure sustainable enjoyment of our parks for future generations.

If you’d like more details about the data or model to include in your writing, I’d be happy to provide additional information or visuals.

Best regards,
