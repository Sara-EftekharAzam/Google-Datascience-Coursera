# **RACI Matrix Activity Report**

## **Part 1: Overview of Common Data Professional Roles**

Before creating the RACI matrix, it is important to understand the key responsibilities of four common data professional roles.

| **Role**                                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Scientist**                      | Works with analytics and statistical models to generate insights that support business decisions. They analyze structured and unstructured data and often build predictive models. |
| **Data Engineer**                       | Designs, builds, and maintains data infrastructure. Responsible for managing databases, creating ETL pipelines, and ensuring that data is clean, consistent, and accessible.       |
| **Analytics Team Manager**              | Leads and supervises analytics projects, ensures alignment with business objectives, manages resources, and approves deliverables from the team.                                   |
| **Business Intelligence (BI) Engineer** | Focuses on transforming data into actionable information through dashboards, reports, and visualization tools. They help business teams access and understand data insights.       |

The project will go through the following tasks:

1. **Define business objectives**
2. **Collect and clean data**
3. **Design and build data pipelines**
4. **Develop predictive models**
5. **Create BI dashboards and visualizations**
6. **Review and approve deliverables**
7. **Communicate insights to executives**

## **Part 3: Explanation of Role Assignments**

* **Responsible (R):**
  The team members who actively complete the work.
  Example: Data Engineers are *responsible* for building pipelines; Data Scientists are *responsible* for developing predictive models.

* **Accountable (A):**
  The person who ensures the task is completed correctly and approves final results.
  Example: The Analytics Team Manager is *accountable* for defining business goals and approving deliverables.

* **Consulted (C):**
  Those who provide expert advice and feedback.
  Example: BI Engineers are *consulted* when designing dashboards; Data Scientists are *consulted* during pipeline creation.

* **Informed (I):**
  Individuals or stakeholders who need updates but are not directly involved in the work.
  Example: Executives and senior leaders are often *informed* of project outcomes.

## **Part 4: Insights and Reflection**

This RACI matrix helps clarify the **distribution of roles and responsibilities** across the data team. By defining who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed for each task:

* Collaboration becomes smoother, reducing confusion and duplication of effort.
* Decision-making is more efficient since accountability is clear.
* Team communication improves because every member knows when to consult or inform others.

Overall, applying the RACI framework enhances the success of data projects by aligning technical roles (Data Engineers, Scientists, BI Engineers) with leadership and strategic oversight (Analytics Team Manager).

✅ **Conclusion:**
The RACI matrix ensures that each data professional understands their contribution and communication responsibilities throughout a project. This structured approach promotes transparency, accountability, and efficiency within the data analytics team.
